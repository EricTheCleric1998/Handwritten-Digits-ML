<b>Handwritten Digits Machine Learning Project: Try 1<\b>

To run this project, you will want to download the handwritten.keras file, the main.py file, AND the digits file.
If you prefer to test your own digits, you do not need to download the digits file itself, rather create one and
add it to the file where you download the main.py.

After downloading the folder, you will want to uncomment line 7-23 if you would like to train the model with more
epochs. If you do this, you have the choice to comment out line 25-39 or not. If you do, you will save a new file
called "handwritten.keras" that has trained with your amount of epochs while not immediately running it. If you
do not comment it out, you will train with your epochs and then immediately run the file. Note I did not train
my model then immediately run it, so I do not know the output if you do this.

handwritten.keras is the file you need that is already pretrained, though, so if you'd like to run that with the
10 trained epochs, you can.

My accuracy on 10 epochs was 75% with the digits I fed it. Your mileage may vary, though the tutorial I followed
got a nearly 92% accuracy on 3 epochs, so I am not sure what I did wrong or how mine changed. I did use different
digits than the YouTuber did, though, which may have lead to the discrepancies.
